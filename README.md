# checkout-line-cli

A little Command Line graphical thing that tracks your position in a "Target" checkout line, written in Go with only 51 lines. :)

Right now, I've begun to learn the Go programming language, and this is one of my first small little programs that I wrote by myself.
To run it, download the ./checkout-line-cli executable and run it in your command line.
